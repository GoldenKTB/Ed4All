**PROBLEM**

Millions, countless of people, right from little tots to adults, do not receive the **Basic Education and Privilege** to build their own successful carer and gain knowledge on worldwide important events and cases. This has a huge negative impact on the person's mental and social well-being. At some point, due to lack of Education, people might start losing their ability to communicate. 
So how do we come in and help?
